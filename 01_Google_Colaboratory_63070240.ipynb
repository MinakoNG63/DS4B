In a code cell, we can type any Python commands, running them by clicking \"Play\" in the toolbar. When we \"play\" a cell, the code in it is executed and it returns whatever is the result of running a code. (Maybe an error!)  You can modify and re-run code cells multiple times in any order. Importantly note that code cells will always start with \"`In [ ]:`\".\n",

That is, some of the results of running a cell are \"remembered\" for subsequent cells, as long as the session continues running.  Usually the session keeps running as long as you don't stop your instance and you keep the notebook window open.  Sometimes when you get errors in running your cells, it's because something from a prior cell was forgotten for some reason.  If you look above under the dropdown menu Kernel above, you'll see that there are options for clearing your outputs, rerunning all the cells, etc.\n",
